# StackOverflow

Stack Overflow is an application that displays questions and answers (using Entity Framework). A user can log in to ask, answer, and like a question. Any user, whether logged in or not, can view the questions and answers.

To get the project up and running: Navigate to the `StackOverflow.Data` folder in your command line. Once in the correct folder, type in the command line `dotnet ef database update`. This will create a database in SQL Server and then the project will be able to run.

Thank you!
